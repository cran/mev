mev v1.4 (Release date: )
==============

* NEW: empirical and Euclidean likelihood estimation of spectral measure


mev v1.3 (Release date: 2015-10-05)
==============

Changes:

* Extremal Dirichlet model now implemented with "ef"
* Added Smith and asymmetric (negative) logistic model (differs from bivariate setting for aneglog, given that the later is not a valid DF according to Stephenson).
* rmev can now return arrays for random fields on regular grids ("hr","exstud" and "smith" models).



mev v1.2 (Release date: 2015-08-23)
==============

Changes:

* Added the negative bilogistic and the scaled Dirichlet models.
* Extremal Dirichlet model implemented with "sm" only.

mev v1.1 (Release date: 2015-08-19)
==============

Changes:

* Implementation of sampler from spectral distribution, moving rdirspec and rbilogspec to background along with other functions.

* Fixed a typo in rPextstud setting arguments of newly created arma vector to zero

mev v1.0 (Release date: 2014-08-16)
